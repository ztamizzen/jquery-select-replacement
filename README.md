# jquery-select-replacement

A replacement of the vexatious select drop down.

## Usage, it's very basic

- You _wrap_ the `select` and `label` in a `div` (or your element of choice).
- You assign the attribute `title` with a more descriptive replacement of the `text value` to the `<option>`.
- You assign the data attribute of `cls` (short for class as in `className`) to all `<option>`.
